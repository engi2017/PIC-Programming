# PIC-Programming
Welcome!

PIC-Programming is website created by the tech class of John Fraser Secondary School to educate tech-inspired students to build a line following robot. The website is hosted through github, and can be reached through the convenient link www.tinyurl.com/haadware We hope that you enjoy your adventures in building this robot, and learn lots along the way!


Below are the subsections of the website.

Home

As simply put, this button redirects you to the homepage! The main bar will be moved to the righthand side in the other tabs.

About

Some information about the creators of the website, along with the written tutorials + videos.

Software

Under the software tab contains 10 sequential written tutorials aimed to teach students the basics of programming in C.
C is the language used to build the robot, and basic understanding of it will be required to be able to program and debug the robot later on.

Hardware

The hardware section is composed of three written and video tutorials. Two of the tutorials are hardware components of the software tutorial. (Eg. Tutorial 7 teaches students how to export C code into a chip, commanding LEDs to flash.) The last tutorial teaches students how to build the line following robot's hardware, but the coding algorithm is left to as a challenge for the students to develop!
